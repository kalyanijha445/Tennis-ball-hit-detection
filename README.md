# Tennis-ball-hit-detection
 Our project revolves around designing a system to detect tennis ball hits within a defined framed area and visually represent these hits on a computer screen. The aim was to develop a responsive and accurate system that operates in real-time, providing seamless feedback on the ball's impact points.
